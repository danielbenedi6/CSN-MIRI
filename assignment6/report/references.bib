    abstract = "{The preface of this book clearly spells out its intended purpose: it is a how-to book on the use of the nls function in R, rather than a textbook on nonlinear regression. As such, it is intended as a reference for readers with some past experience with R and a reasonable working knowledge of linear regression, or as a supplementary text for a course on nonlinear regression. It serves both purposes pretty well and I judge it to be a handy little book, with a few caveats.The book is laid out in a fairly easy-to-use manner: a person with the prerequisite knowledge and some familiarity with a particular nonlinear model could easily figure out how to fit that model in R without reading the whole book. The coverage of topics follows what would be expected in a typical course on the subject, including starting values, derivatives, diagnostic and remedial measures, and inference. A final chapter covers one special topic, grouped data. In keeping the book concise, the authors cover subjects only in their most essential forms, so variants and special topics are not well explored. The book uses 18 different models as examples, ranging from common (exponential decay, various forms of logistic, and hockey-stick) to esoteric (Antoine model for temperature/pressure relations). However, the book does not discuss their properties or offer comparative analysis, so a practitioner will not find much advice regarding which models to use. Also, there is no theory at all. The authors do steadily direct readers to the books by Bates and Watts (1988) and Seber and Wild (1989) to learn more.}",
