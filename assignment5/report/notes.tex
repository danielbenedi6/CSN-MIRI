 function auxiliary\_functions in clusterAnalytics and 
computes the "Given a weighted graph and a partition into communities, returns the internal edge weight, the size, and the cut weight for each community" 

Size comes directly from auxiliary functions $n_s$
$m_s$ = edge weight
$c_s$ = cut weight


internal density is computed by $m_s * 2/(n_s * (n_s - 1))$

edges inside = $m_s$

av degree = $m_s / n_s$

FOMD (Fraction Over Median Degree): Given a weighted graph and a partition into communities, returns the fraction of nodes of each community whose internal degree (i.e. the degree accounting only intra-community edges) is greater than the median degree of the whole graph.

expansion = $ c_s/n_s$

cut ratio = c_s/(n_s * (n - n_s))
conductance = c_s/(2 * m_s + c_s)
norm cut = c_s/(2 * m_s + c_s) + c_s/(2 * (sum(m_s) - m_s) + c_s)
density ratio = local_density_ratio_Rcpp(aux_vals)
    D[, c("max ODF", "average ODF", "flake ODF")] <- out_degree_fractions(edgelist = el, 
        com = com)

TPR = triangle_participation_ratio_communities -> Computes the triangle participation ratio (proportion of vertices that belong to a triangle). The computation is done to the subgraphs induced by each of the communities in the given partition.

internal_weight <- sum(m_s)
total_weight <- internal_weight + sum(c_s)/2
coverage <- internal_weight/total_weight
