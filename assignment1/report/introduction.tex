 Usage of random graphs is relevant in different areas in order to model several behaviors. During this assignment, we will try to empirically understand the properties of some models in random graphs such as the Erdös-Rényi model (Section \ref{cha: Erdös-Rényi model}) and the Watts-Strogatz model (Section \ref{cha: Watts-Strogatz model}).
